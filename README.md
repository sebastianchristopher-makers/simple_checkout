# Project: Simple Checkout

Original project [here](https://diode.makersacademy.com/students/samjones1001/projects/317)
##To achieve these goals:

###Action Plan

Write the code for a supermarket checkout that can calculate the price of a number of items. Each item should be priced individually, and the checkout should be able to scan them in any order.

The requirements for the system are as follows:
```
As a shopper
So I know how much an item costs
I would like to be able to see its price

As a shopper
So that I can buy an item
I would like to be able to scan items at the checkout

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to be able to see a total for all scanned items

As a shopper
So that I know how much to pay
I would like to see all prices correctly formatted (Â£xx.xx)
```
You main focus here should be to follow a rigorous TDD process: RED, GREEN, REFACTOR!

###Evidence Plan

You'll be able to explain the approach you took to writing your code and justify some of the decisions you made (emotional)

You will have a well tested, working implementation of the system described above (empirical)

You will discuss your approach with a coach, describing your TDD process, and will receive feedback (credible)
